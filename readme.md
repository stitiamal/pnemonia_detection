# Pneumonia Detection

## About The Project

Pneumonia Detection is a deep learning project that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images into two classes: pneumonia and normal. The model helps in the early detection of pneumonia, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment process.

## Features

- Pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images.
- Easy-to-use prediction tool.
- Scalable model training and evaluation.

## Dataset

The project uses the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset, available from [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.7 or higher.
- Required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Make sure you have installed the required dependencies as mentioned in the Installation section.

Run the prediction tool: ../image_test.jpg

### Model Training

python train.py

### Evaluate the model 

python test.py
